  #### Motivation 
  
  ##### Finding parking spot can be time consuming especially during peak hours. 
  ##### What if we can check which parking slot is available and notify drivers to find it. 
  
   #### Goal 
  ##### Using Camera to check the parking spot. (CNN)  
  ##### creating a map that corresponding to the parking lot. 
  ##### The system can manage the data and show the imformation which parking slots are available. 
  ##### The information will be transferred to other device and tell users the available parking slots. 
  
   #### Deliverable 
  ##### Week4: Decide equipment, research, programming language. 
  ##### Week5: Apply Machine learning to recognize cars (Analysis which models can be used) 
  ##### Week6: Testing image recognition, optimize the model  
  ##### Week7: Create a map that correspond to the parking lot. 
  ##### Week8: Matching the available parking slot 
  ##### Week9: Sending data to other device (mobile phone) 
  ##### Week10: Demo, final presentation
