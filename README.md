### Project Introduction
#### Motivation
Finding parking spot can be time consuming especially during peak hours.
What if we can check which parking slot is available and notify drivers to find it.

#### Goal
Using Camera to check the parking spot. (CNN) 
creating a map that corresponding to the parking lot.
The system can manage the data and show the imformation which parking slots are available.
The information will be transferred to other device and tell users the available parking slots.

#### Deliverable
Week4: Decide equipment, research, programming language.
Week5: Apply Machine learning to recognize cars (Analysis which models can be used)
Week6: Testing image recognition, optimize the model  
Week7: Create a map that correspond to the parking lot.
Week8: Matching the available parking slot
Week9: Sending data to other device (mobile phone)
Week10: Demo, final presentation

### Hardware Used in This Project
Camera, Arduino, mobile Phone, PC
