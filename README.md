  ### Project Introduction 
  
  #### Motivation 
  
  * Finding parking spot can be time consuming especially during peak hours. 
  * We know that a lot of indoor parking lots have sensors on each parking slot to detect whether a car is parking. The available parking slot would turn on a green LED light to notify driver. In addition, the indoor parking lots have monitor to tell drivers how many parking slots are available.
  * But the outdoor parking lots do not have this system. It is not accurate to use sensors to detect vehicles from outdoor because the sensor can be affected by a leaf or something else. Also, flashing a LED light from outdoor is not easy to see. Therefore, it would be useful to implement a camera to check the available parking slots
  * Notify drivers the available parking slots especially during the peak time. 
  
   #### Goal 
  * Using Camera to check the parking spot. (CNN)  
  * creating a map that corresponding to the parking lot. 
  * The system can manage the data and show the imformation which parking slots are available. 
  * The information will be transferred to other device and tell users the available parking slots. 
  
   #### Deliverable 
  * Week4: Decide equipment, research, programming language. 
  * Week5: Apply Machine learning to recognize cars (Analysis which models can be used) 
  * Week6: Testing image recognition, optimize the model  
  * Week7: Create a map that correspond to the parking lot. 
  * Week8: Matching the available parking slot 
  * Week9: Sending data to other device (mobile phone) 
  * Week10: Demo, final presentation 
  
   ### Hardware Used in This Project 
  * Camera, Arduino, mobile Phone, PC
